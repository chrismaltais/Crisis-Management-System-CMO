This implementation has

init map - intitalize map

add marker function
- with coordinates, icons, infowindow
- assigned an id to each marker

delete marker function
-delete marker by id

calculate the center point
To-do:require the coordinates,
algorithm to dynamically calculate not done

create a marker showing center point
-custom image

calculate distance
To-do: 
-given center point, 
-iteratively find distance from center to each coordinate (in metres)
-obtain max of the distance
- add 200 to the distance and pass it as the radius

create a circle showing the affected are
-radius is from calculatedistance
