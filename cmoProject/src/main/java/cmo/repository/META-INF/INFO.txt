All files in cmo.repository package are interfaces for their respective entity class in cmo.entities package.
Spring Boot does not require additional class file for these interfaces as long as the methods inside follow the following naming: getBy{VariableName}.

Example for entity class SampleEntity with variable id:


public interface SampleRepository implements CrudRepository<SampleEntity, Long> {
	
	public SampleEntity findById(int id);
	
}
